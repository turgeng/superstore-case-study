# Superstore Sales Analysis

This project analyzes the Superstore dataset to uncover insights about product sales, customer segments, and regional profitability. It was conducted using R and tidyverse packages.

## Objective

To answer key business questions such as:
- Which products generate the most revenue?
- What customer segments are the most profitable?
- Are there product categories with high sales but low margins?

## Tools Used

- **R**
- **tidyverse**
- **ggplot2**
- **RMarkdown**

## Key Insights

- **Tables**, despite high sales, generate negative profit â€” a critical product-level red flag.
- The **Home Office** segment has the highest average profit margin (14.3%) despite the lowest total sales.
- The **West** region is the most profitable; **Central** region shows room for margin improvement.
